There's a game called Enter the Gungeon my brother and I used to play.
It was really hard, and what made it harder was that we were both used
to playing on keyboards, but only one of us could use a keyboard. This
meant one of us had to use a controller, which sucked. Anyways, I made
this program so that we can just bind keys on different keyboards, and
change the keyboard controls for player 1 and player 2.

This program must be run as root.
